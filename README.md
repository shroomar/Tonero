Introduction 

We present the Tonero protocol. A revolutionary idea in communication in a pear to pear decentralised disorganised manner. which can completely replace current systems that rely on websites and web servers and third party service providers. Instead in Tonero any device can connect to any other device instantly and absolutely for free without the need for middlemen. 

The use cases are endless and we will discuss them with more details later but for now to give the reader an idea we are talking about everything from a file sharing system to a free speech platform where news and ideas can be shared in unstoppable censor resistant way. private self-deleting messages and encrypted emails. Even remote controllers are possible.

The system can not be directly monetised and will always remain free of charge for anyone anywhere at anytime, however it can also be used for economical purposes for example by publishing adds for free. The company wishing to advertise certain products can use Tonero for free just like everyone else can. It can also be used for donations and kick-starting projects and crowdfunding campaigns.

But more importantly by connecting buyers and sellers, the exchange of goods and services can be agreed upon directly on Tonero in fact an entire free open market can be build using it.
So how is all this possible. The idea is very simple as we will see. Before we introduce the solution lets make sure we understand the problem.

The Data Market

To send an email a person has to send it first to a web server then to the desired destination. This service is provided by a third party. Such as google with their gmail. This is the same for everything from videos on youtube to google drive and even chat apps. Nothing is transferred directly between users.

Now while the user doesn’t directly pay for these services. Its not free in fact its very expensive to send a simple email. Servers have to be maintained and kept cool with air conditioning, electricity bills have to be paid, they are run by giant corporations hiring a lot of staff and large storage facilities are needed. So if it is not the user paying for all of this then who is. Well it is as we all know everyone from advertise companies and government spy agencies as well as independent hackers and scammers and spammers. 
They all are more than happy to pay for the expenses for access to user information. Every email ever send is never deleted and always kept on the cloud which is what they call their servers. To be sold again and again to anyone willing to pay. 
Put simply the user is not the customer but the product. 
This of course doesn’t just happen to emails but everything every image uploaded to any site to any message written on any app. Its all being spied on and stored indefinitely.     

On top of that the service provider can choose to censor information. A post on a social media platform can simply be taken down any account can be blocked a video can be censored. 
So only the information they want to be visible to the public can remain. 
This not only kills free speech but controls the population directly by manipulating the flow of information and disinformation they have access to.
After all people do what they think is right and most of them believe what they are told and they are told things by a very limited group of people who control all media.

Who decides what is right or wrong. Might makes right as it has always did.
Every statistics and research will always show what those who funded it want it to show. For if it showed anything else they will simply fund someone else to say what they want. It is the way everything works. No media agency can ever be independent and free because it doesn’t pay to share the truth. It pays to say what you were hired to say. And all media agencies are owned by the same companies. Even when they claim they support different political factions. 
There is and never was any trust worthy source of information.

The only hope here is to give users access to all available information and let them choose for themselves what to believe. 
Now solving this without eliminating the costs is impossible. And maintaining a third party service will always have costs. So the only solution is pear to pear networks. Where a user can send data to another user directly without connecting to a central server between them. It doesn’t cost anything because there is no one to pay. 

Bit torrent

now you may be wondering doesn’t this already exist after all, pear to pear network are not new. People are already sharing everything from movies to books on bit torrent. However to share a torrent file. A link to the file still has to be uploaded to a web site that site has to be hosted on a server and it needs a known URL. And users have to search for this website on another website to find it. 
Bit torrent doesn’t offer a way to search for files within the program itself and no way to upload directly. This website can be closed by governments or at least blocked and arbitrarily declared illegal do to copy write laws or other reasons. The site can also spy on its users and the files they are sharing. 
So the website is a single point of failure and that is the problem. While downloading and uploading the file itself is pear to pear. Access to the file link is not.

Now the system that bit torrent uses is very efficient, the file is split into different parts that can be downloaded separately from different sources at the same time. This makes it easier and faster. Bit torrent even has a business model, users who upload complete files known as seeders are paid with a token called BTT (bit torrent token) that runs on Tron blockchain, and users who own BTT can download files faster. 

The cookie monster

as discussed above the main problem of bit torrent is the lack of a pear to pear link sharing system. So it has to rely on websites. When users visit a site they are presented with a window asking them to accept cookies and they have to accept it to use the site so its not really a choice. This cookie is a file stored on the user’s device and stores information about sites used and what the user did on those site. 
Then when the same user visits another site. The other site has access to all cookies even the ones generated by different sites. Now while users can delete these cookies from their local devices (most don’t) they can’t however delete the information stored on the site’s database that is stored on the server and not on the user’s local device. 
The user can’t access or delete this data and it is owned by the site.

But why do sites do this. Even small sites that are owned by normal people, it is because they want users to find their site and increase traffic, for that they need their site to appear on search engines and preferably on the first page. so they need to use google analytics that records user activities and collects statistics.
They also need to pay bills on the site and maintain it, for that they need to show adds and the add companies want to know what users are interested in to show them specific adds so they spy on people. Then governments spy agencies simply buy this information or even confiscate it for free from the people who collect it for economical reasons.
In fact they don’t need to spy directly anymore since people now spy on themselves.
So again the problem is cost and searching. By making it easy to find information for free this solves all problems.

The Onion

a VPN is a virtual private network that users can connect to then that connects to the site. So its a middle layer of protection that way the website doesn’t know which user is connecting to It. Since the IP address of the user is hidden, however this just means that the company that runs the VPN now has all that information because they see which IP address is connecting to which site. So it is pointless and also using a VPN isn’t free. So users are paying a company to maintain their privacy but there is no guarantee that this company itself isn’t spying on them. 

Tor on the other hand is special, it is free and it is not run by a company it is a pear to pear network. Tor or the onion router not only protects the users but also protects the sites by using a layered system like an onion where each node connects to another one and so on, so the user connects to a website not directly but through many links in between this makes the whole process very slow. 
So when a user connects to a website using Tor the website doesn’t know the user’s IP address and the user doesn’t know the site’s IP address. 
However since Tor is free to use. There is no economic incentive for people to support the network and so it doesn’t have enough nodes. This makes it very slow and so most people don’t use Tor in their everyday lives. 

It also suffers from the same problem that bit torrent does. Since the website URL on Tor is kept secret it doesn’t even show up on search engines and these sites are collectively called the dark web, so how can users even find them. Well the link to the site has to be shared on a regular site on the regular clear net. Because Tor doesn’t offer a way to share links directly the system while brilliant is incomplete. 
This makes using the dark net very dangerous for normal people since they don’t know the good dark net sites and risk entering the wrong ones. In fact most dark net sites are probably fronts for different governments and hackers trying to trap people.

Blockchains

another type of pear to pear network is known as a blockchain. All data is stored on every device known as a full node. So deleting the data from anyone of them doesn’t do anything as there will always be another copy on some other node.
Put simply a blockchain is a shared database of information that is agreed upon and there lies the challenge.  

Naturally the main difficulty is achieving consensus which is the process that all the nodes agree on the correct state and more importantly the correct order of the network. The best and most understood way to achieve this is proof of work POW which is what is referred to as mining. But mining is not free it costs many resources firstly disk space to store the blockchain second the power bill to pay to run the machines and keep them cool. All though in winter there is no need for cooling and the mining devices can also be used for heating. However they are loud so it is not exactly comfortable

And on top of that it reduces the life of the hardware needed to perform all these calculations such as the CPU or GPU or Asic. Since these components are being used for long periods under high temperatures and are overloaded to their maximum capacity.
Lastly is the time it takes to sync to the blockchain. So it costs time, space, money and hardware longevity.
And the users have to pay for these costs either as tips and fees or simply as inflation.
One way or the other someone has to pay to maintain the system.
since mining is hard many users of the network will understandably not participate in it. Those who chose to mine have to compete between each other to collect the rewards and so to gain an edge. They form large groups known as mining pools. And thus the solo miner doesn’t have a chance. 

Now the system still works because as long as there are enough people mining it is fine and miners can jump from pool to pool (at least in theory) so even if a pool misbehaves 
miners can simply direct their hash power to support another pool and that pool will be out of business thus they have an incentive to behave.
In practice however miners can be careless or greedy or simply too lazy to actually switch from pool to pool even though it is a click of a button. Many will choose to stay in the biggest pool which pays them the most amount with the most consistency. 
After all lets remember that miners have bills to pay and sometimes can’t risk lowering their income.  

And so as we now see the largest pool in bitcoin wants to start censoring transactions. 
Whether willingly or under pressure from governments the end result is the same. 
Mining pools also have to pay taxes and follow regulations so they are part of the system and not a parallel isolated system.

Actual dangers to blockchains

but why is mining actually needed. What could possibly go wrong.
First a blockchain is a chain of blocks. Each block is a list of transactions. And each one of those was signed by its sender agreeing to the contents of the transaction. It is not mathematically possible to forge a signature at least as far as we know. So mining isn’t needed to verify transactions since all nodes do that any way. 

The real danger is known as double spend which is producing two conflicting transactions as in the same money going to different addresses. Both transactions are valid in the sense that they are signed by the right signature. But they can’t both be accepted since that would result in doubling the money.
So one transaction has to be rejected. And naturally the first one will be accepted so it depends on the order or timing of transactions. 

Unlike signatures there is no mathematical way to verify a timestamp. The sender of the transaction can claim the transaction is older than it is. As in can claim he/she send the transaction a couple of minutes ago when in fact it was sent seconds ago for example and there is no way to verify that.
So this is why mining is needed. 
The idea is that no block will be accepted with two or more conflicting transactions
then the blockchain behaves as a strange time keeping device. So the older blocks happen before the new ones. The way they are chained together is that each new block contains a hash (a trace) from the last one. So it is very easy to order transactions this way. So miners by putting transactions in blocks are effectively dating them and agreeing on the order and by referring to this order any conflict can be resolved easily. 

So then the real danger becomes rewriting the blockchain history or part of it without the old transaction to allow for the new conflicting one to be falsely accepted. Mining also makes this pretty impossible since writing a block consumes resources and all the blocks are connected by the chain. To Change one block the forger has to change every block that comes after it. And so to change an old block requires doing all the work for all the new ones that came after it before another miner adds a new block. 
So the nodes simply have to pick the longest chain to make sure nothing was deleted from it and thus reject any transaction that conflict with any old one already in the blockchain history. And that is how consensus is reached and how double spend is avoided. The longest chain with the most work that went into it is the one where nothing was deleted from it and so it is the correct one. It is a really simple but genius system

One final danger remains which actually comes form the solution to the first one. Since now miners have to add transactions to blocks to make them accepted as valid. What if they refuse to accept otherwise valid transactions this is what we mean by censoring. Or they can refuse to make new blocks all together and thus stall the blockchain for a while. 
Since this is very hard. These miners will keep loosing money while they are trying to stall transactions. And not just money but actual real world resources like time and energy and hardware. 
So this is why mining is effective at securing the system. 

Lets consider what happened to Eth after the hack, Even so it had a large number of miners at the time most choose to follow the company’s decision and only a minority choose to remain free. What makes this worse is that it wasn’t the choice of inverters or even miners. What settled the matter were the stable coin providers Tether and Circle that choose ETH over ETC. Since a forking of the chain doubles the coin which is fine for normal coins because it just diluted the value. But everything still works.
But for stable coins this can’t be allowed since to keep them pegged to the value of a dollar the supply can’t just double like that as that will break the peg.

The stable coin provider can choose what coins to recognise on what chain. And naturally they will side with the company they are in bed with. Then exchanges follow with the same reasons calling actual Etherium By the made up name Etherium classic. And fake Etherium by simply Etherium. Which made inverters think it is was the original one and not the fork. Even though it was ETH miners that rewrote the history of the blockchain and deleted transactions. While in ETC they simply did nothing and refused to alter the correct history of the chain. So if the majority agree on a false history it doesn’t matter that a minority is still keeping the correct one and can prove it mathematically. This is the only way POW can fail.

If POW can fail then naturally Proof of Stake POS has no chance at securing anything. Since it is just consensus by following the nodes controlling the most stake and coins are minted out of thin air at the launch of the network and sold as stocks to investors while the company that made the blockchain keeps the majority. And rewriting the history of the blockchain costs nothing since no work into it. So the company that made the blockchain controls the majority of the stake and so can easily rewrite anything they want and consensus will always agree with them. 
So POS is a just a new name for the old banking system. The stakers are simply the share holders of the security and as every company must follow regulations and pay taxes. POS so can never be an independent system.

Privacy is freedom and security
	
the real solution is actually just privacy. Since if the transactions are encrypted there is no real way to censor them since you won’t know what you are censoring in the first place. And by the same logic deleting some of them will never produce a believable false history of the blockchain without knowing what you are tempering with. 
Simply put you can’t alter information you don’t see. So the real answer isn’t actually miners or POW it is just privacy.

Now does that mean that miners aren’t really needed to secure a private blockchain like Monero. Well they are probably not needed to prevent double spend or censoring since that is already not very feasible on Monero. (this is debatable)
In fact Monero also locks all used funds for 10 blocks (20 minutes by average) so a malice user doesn’t even have the time to try to double spend anything. 
So to use a blockchain as a cryptocurrency the only acceptable standard should be complete privacy. And Monero is the most tested and adopted private blockchain however any fork (copy) of Monero should work the same way. Even with a smaller number of miners should be fine and secure.
	
Smart contracts

The use for blockchains for reasons other than money is usually known as smart contracts. A smart contract is simply a program running on a blockchain, to deploy or interact with one of them. A user has to create a special transaction that refers to the contract’s address on the blockchain. This transaction has to be then included in a block and goes through consensus to be accepted by the blockchain. 
While smart contracts (depending on which blockchain) can be Turing complete which means they can (in theory) do any calculation needed and do everything a normal program can. This can be very expensive as these transactions that have to be stored on a blockchain will be very big in size and so waste valuable disk space on the full nodes. 
They can also be non deterministic as in it wont be clear before execution how long it will take to run the smart contract so the user ends up paying more in fees than was agreed upon. 

There is real dangers to using smart contracts as they are programmable money. This means that if you sign and approve a contract. You can end up spending money automatically and sometimes these contracts can be misleading or even simply a scam to steal people’s money. The main threat is however that governments use this new technology to create what they call CBDC. 

A Central bank digital currency which is programmable money that the government directly controls and so they can ban certain transactions for example buying meat, or even have a system that drains people’s account at the end of every month to make it impossible for people to save money and have to live paycheck to paycheck and be forced to work as slaves. Or simply put a limit or a maximum amount on an account or they can do the exact opposite. For example not allowing people to spend more than a fixed amount. In fact banks already do this now.

While smart contracts are a tool that can be used for good and evil. They also suffer from the same problems. 
You see to access a smart contract a user has to use a front end website that grants a user friendly way to interact with the contract. 
While the contract itself exist on the chain and not the server. Without the site (that does exist outside the chain on a server) normal people will find it impossible to even find the contract and wont know how to use it.

So if the site was shut down or hacked the ability for people to use the smart contract will be gone. While in theory it is possible for anyone to create any number of sites to interact with any smart contract. In practice however there is usually just one made by the same person that wrote the contract in the first place. And this person has to maintain the site and advertises it. And usually collects fees from the contract to pay for that and generates profits which is the whole point of the smart contract.

And this is why smart contracts are not the solution while they may be useful, in fact in Monero they are not allowed for fear of losing privacy and control of funds. As well as losing scalability and a drain of resources. 

The scam of NFTs become popular lately so what is a NFT. It is simply a URL link to a file stored on a server. The file is usually just a silly image but in theory can be anything. This URL is then stored on a blockchain usually inside a smart contract 
and attached to addresses thus giving people ownership of the URL but not the actual file that exists on a server and is owned by the owner of the server.
	Mordinals on Monero on the other hand are different. On Monero smart contracts are not allowed. However there is still a way to attach a file to transaction. This file unlike an NFT actually exist on the blockchain. And is contained completely inside the transaction. However they pose a threat to the privacy of transactions and also waste valuable disk space. So we don’t recommend using them. 
And now hopefully the reader fully understands the problems we are trying to solve and will now show it can be solved by Tonero.

The Tonero Protocol

We have shown that under the POW blockchain model, the only need to mining and consensus is agreeing on the order of transaction and attaching a correct timestamp to every transaction. But what if we use a blockchain for something other than money, simply for sending messages. 

If time was irrelevant we don’t actually need any consensus. Any data is valid for example if someone was making a statement expressing an opinion about a certain topic or simply sharing a funny meme or a song. Does it really matter when the massage was sent. No, what we actually care about is that data is transmitted from one computer to the other in a secure private way. If we don’t care when it was send and when it will be arrive then the order of messages become meaningless. Since we are not dealing with money here. There can’t be double spend. It is just random information.

To summarize the only need for consensus which is the ability to reject a transaction for the reason that it conflicts with an older one. For the sole purpose of using a blockchain as a cryptocurrency without allowing an amount to falsely double. 
However if a blockchain was used to transmit messages that are not a record of transactions and are not meant to be understood as a currency. 
Then no two messages can ever be in conflict since there is no central authority to decide that anything is right or wrong. Any massage then is valid and any node can verify the sender of the massage by verifying the signature which is trivially done. 
And so by not caring about the timing of when the massages were originally sent we completely eliminate the cost of sending them from node to node.
We propose the use of any blockchain to send information in a pear to pear way. Without conforming to any rules about consensus. The idea is very simple 
construct a transaction that can’t be accepted by the network 
this can be done by different methods
    • wrong signature
    • empty wallet (or amount send is more than what is in the wallet)
    • zero fee … etc
      
then we attach a file to the transaction either inside a smart contract or Mordinal or anything similar.
then we broadcast this transaction to the network

So what will happen. Well this transaction will obviously not be accepted and will never be included in any block. And so there can’t be a cost since no fee is paid for rejected transactions. Lets remember the only cost is to participate in consensus. But we don’t care about that because we don’t care about the dating and ordering of messages.
You see we are not using the blockchain as a time keeping device or as a money system or a permanent storage. we are instead using it as temporary information relay system. 

These special transactions will sit in the mempool (memory pool) which is a waiting area transactions exist in until they are approved by some miner and added to a block. Except these wont be approved so they will never be in the blockchain. They will never waste space or resources. 

They will simply be there forever waiting in the mempool. Even if they are deleted after a while it is perfectly fine by us. We don’t care about storage we care about transportation. 
After all a massage can always be send again and again. 
Then while they are in the mempool they are visible to any node that Is interested. Any user can choose to download file from any of these transactions and store it locally. Then if he/she wishes share it by resending it the same way. The user can simply delete it it is not worth storing.
We also propose adding certain filters to make sure that miners don’t have to worry about these transactions. They can simply look at the transactions read the first few bytes from each one and identify it as a Tonero transaction and ignore it. 
They don’t need to waste any resources on them.

While users of Tonero will do the exact opposite. They will filter out the non Tonero massages. So the two systems can run on parallel without conflict. 

Tonero is Torrent on Monero

Phase one we propose using Monero for testing the system and flushing out any potential problems. then phase two branching out to other and all blockchains. this is the gist of It. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel here.
So we will use regular torrent files (the magnet link) as mordinals in Monero transactions siting in the mempool which is usually empty thanks to the dynamic block sizes and low fees in the Monero blockchain.
So we have solved bit torrent’s only problem. 

Now a user can create a torrent file and then instead of uploading the link to a website. Can directly send the link to the desired node privately or share it publicly with everyone. Then the receiving node after downloading the link can use bit torrent to download the actual file. 
Keep in mind that this doesn’t need to be a full node since syncing to the blockchain isn’t needed. The listening node only cares about pending transactions with zero confirmations called Oconf.
And not old transactions stored in the blockchain.

Since there is no waiting for confirmations. Because there will never be any. The system is instantly fast. The moment the massage is send it is visible on the network with no delay other than connection speeds (mere milliseconds). 
So there is no wasted time. 
There is also no wasted space as we mentioned above. Since no user has to store any file he/she doesn’t want to.  And some massages only need to be read and then discarded anyway. 

There is also no cost since no one is providing this service to anyone. There is no one to collect fees and no fees to be collected. 
And finally there is no damage to the blockchain as we are simply running a protocol parallel to the main one without interfering with their work. We are simply using preexisting infrastructure without damaging it in any way. 

There is no danger to the Monero system since theses transactions are not mixed with the real ones they will not interfere with ring signatures or be a threat to user privacy. They will also not waste disk space in the full node or increase the size of the blockchain and wont make mining any harder. So the users of Monero can carry on with their business without any inconvenience to them. The last thing we want is to harm Monero in anyway. 

So Tonero is free for use by anyone anywhere at anytime for any reason without limits or costs of any kind. Other than bandwidth (internet connection speed)
anyone with access to fast internet can use Tonero without possibility of anyone interfering.

As we can see this is truly a parallel isolated system a true pear to pear network. 

Technical details

These massages we will refer to as MPMs a memory pool massage. 
An MPM consists of a false transaction (non Confirmable) with an extra field memo called a mordinal.
we propose this structure for the mordinal.
    • Tonero prefix (this is a few special bytes to indicate that this is a MPM)
      this will be the same for all MPMs
    • Unique Identifier number UIN (this is a random number to make sure the same user doesn’t download the same massage twice and waste time) this number should be unique and generated randomly when a new massage is send. But we should use the same UIN when resending the same massage
    • Time limit 
      If not zero. this means this message should auto delete itself from any node that downloads it after a sometime (in seconds). This helps reduce spam and hide sensitive information but the user may wish to keep it anyway so there will be an option for that.
      If zero this message wont auto delete itself.
    • Public or private (one bit)
      This just indicates whether this memo is intended for personal or private use or for public viewing. If it is indeed private the rest of it should be encrypted by some public key. And can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.
    • General File metadata (this includes)
        ◦ Text/torrent if it is text. Then the receiving user will know to decode it as ASCII or some other indicated code.
          If torrent. Then it is only the link to the file called the magnet. The user then downloads the link from the mordinal and adds it to bit torrent where it will be downloaded as a normal torrent file using bit torrent.
        ◦ hashtags (list of keywords to describe the file or topic of comment)
    • Response Metadata like a comment or reaction system.
	if users download something they think is bad for what ever reason they can 
	choose to re upload it to the network with attached metadata for example 	spam/add keywords … etc to warn other users. They will use the same UIN to 	send this massage. the other users when they see two massages sharing the 	same 	UIN they can scan 	the ones with response metadata to check for such 	warnings to avoid downloading certain files.
	but it can also be positive metadata such as a like or emoji or even a small	 	comment … etc 
    • Finally the actual data as in the text or torrent magnet.

how we put it all together 

  • a special Monero wallet that should never receive any funds and remain empty.
  • The wallet called a Tonero Node or TN (doesn't sync to the blockchain)
  • the TN scans the mempool for pending transactions with Oconf then filters them based on user choice 
      ◦ Eg: look for certain key words in the file name or in the metadata or hashtags this can be used to search for only PNGs, PDFs … etc
          or search by category such as cat videos for example.
        ◦ Eg: look for a certain file by UIN
        ◦ Eg: look for massages sent by people in the general local area (for a dating app for example or to trade goods in person) completely replacing current systems like tinder and even uber.   
        ◦ Eg: avoid certain keywords for other reasons such as offending words or views contrary to the user views on a certain topic. 
        ◦ Eg: avoid ones with attached warnings such as adds. 
        ◦ Eg: listen for a specific sender address. This massage should contain a signature in the metadata contained in the hash. This is separate from the signature in the actual transaction so miners have nothing to do with it. 
          As we mentioned miners aren’t actually needed to verify signatures any node can do that. By following known cryptography 
    • The wallet can also keep a list of files by UINs already downloaded even if the files were later deleted by the user. To avoid downloading the same junk twice. 
    • The TN can permanently save certain files locally if the user wants to and deletes the rest.  
    • The TN can also upload files by constructing NCTs (non Confirmable transactions) with violations to the consensus by sending funds from an empty wallet (as all TN should be) or without a signature and then broadcasting them to the network
    • The TN as discussed above can resend any massage with attached metadata or as is. 
    • The TN can also be programmed to send some information repeatably at certain times for example once a day.
    • The TN can also be programmed to perform certain actions when some special massage from a certain address is received. This is the basis for remote control 
      Eg: a user can send a Tonero massage from his phone to his computer with a command to play a certain song. Really the possibilities are endless. 
    • Finally this can be used to send private encrypted massages between friends and family. One user can send an MPM mark it as private and encrypt it with the receiver address public key. And then signs it with his private key
      the receiver will receive and decrypt the massage with his/her private key then verify the signature by comparing it with the senders public key. 

Note: when sending a publicly viewable massage there is absolutely no reason to use an address you actually own the private key to. Since this transaction wont be valid anyway. So your identity and privacy is protected and never revealed since using Monero already uses Tor and hides your IP.
On the other hand to send a private massage you would use your actual address since you do have to sign so that the receiver knows it came from you. (if you are massaging someone you know or doing business with for example) But since the massage contents will be encrypted this doesn’t matter. Even if your public key is publicly known to everyone they still wont know who you are sending this massage to and what is in it since they can’t decrypt it.

Complete example

	A user needs to render a 3d scene however lacks the hardware needed to perform 
the action. The user simply creates a torrent file containing (the blender files for example). Then shares the magnet link to the torrent on Tonero. With the price the he is willing to pay for it and other metadata explaining details. Then constructs an NCT containing the mordinal then broadcast this transaction for free publicly.
A second user with a render farm or using a distributed computing network accepts the offer and renders the scene creating a video clip. Then creates a torrent file containing the video as well as a Monero public address to receive the payment. Then sends the NCT on Tonero. Note the video can be encrypted and the user may wish to only send the decrypted key after receiving the money. And the MPM can be send privately encrypted by the public address of the sender who requested the render.
Finally the user downloads the file from the mempool and sends the money via normal Monero transaction. As we can see Monero and Tonero can run in parallel with two types of transactions never interfering with each other and will actually increase the adoption and use cases for both of them.

Summary

This is not a service provided by anyone. Instead this is a new way of doing things. A complete re imagining of the how the world works. So this can be used on any and all existing blockchains and when new one are made Tonero will work on the those future ones too.

The reason we have explained how we intent this new technology be used is that it is the vision and the overall picture that was missing as the infrastructure was already there. It is the vision that is important not the tech. A file sharing system using blockchain memory pools as a temporary means of transmission of information privately and securely between users of a pear to pear network for the purpose of creating a free world built on an open free truly capitalist market promoting complete freedom of speech without any forms of restrictions or censorship of ideas or opinions. Conforming to no arbitrarily social rules of any kind and absolutely unstoppable all while being cost less, free without wasting any resources instantly fast and accessible to anyone anywhere at any time for any reason. In short a better internet.
	In the end this is an idea and once it is in the minds of people they will always find ways to achieve it. To make it into a reality regardless of potential difficulties. 
And this is where you come in, help us make this a reality and not a mere dream so if you have expertise or ideas please share them. No one is stopping you from building this system your self or at least helping to build it, so start writing code !
